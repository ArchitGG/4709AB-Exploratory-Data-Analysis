##Chart 2
##Chart 2 was intended to show the relationship between the number of vaccine doses distributed and the number of people vaccinated. As seen in the plot itself, as the number of vaccine doses distributed increased, the number of people getting vaccinated increased until a little plateau near the end of the x and y axis. The plateau could have to do with enough people recieving doses and an influx of doses being distributed still.
